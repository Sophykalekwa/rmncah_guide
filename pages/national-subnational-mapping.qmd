# National and sub-national mapping of health service coverage

## Rationale, Approach and implementation

**Rationale: Scientific basis for the analysis**

Mapping is a powerful approach for visualizing geographical inequalities in health indicators, particularly useful at regional, provincial, or district levels. It effectively summarizes disparities across many administrative units when these differences are substantial.

Before developing a map, the following considerations are crucial:

1.  Inspect the range of indicator values across administrative units before mapping.
2.  Check the mapâ€™s legend after creation and avoid using maps if legend intervals reflect only minor differences, as this could mislead readers about the magnitude of inequalities.
3.  While maps can also illustrate changes in geographical inequalities over time, it is important to ensure such changes are substantial enough to warrant visualization.

**Approach: Description of analytical steps**

The inequalities can be computed indicator by indicator. To obtain a general comprehensive overview of inequalities the Countdown introduced a Composite Coverage Index (CCI) which include family planning (demand satisfied with modern methods), maternal and newborn care (ANC 4^th^ visit and institutional delivery coverage), immunization (BCG, penta/DTP3 and measles) and treatment seeking behaviour for sick children (ORS for diarrhoea, facility visits for respiratory illness).^[\[1\]](#_ftn1)^

**Implementation: Conducting analysis in the Shiny App**

This will be analysed within the **National analyses** -\>**Subnational Mapping** section in the Shiny App

You expect to see output as below
