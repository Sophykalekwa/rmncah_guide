# Loading Health facility data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}

```

This section explains how to structure and upload data into the app, ensuring compatibility with the **Countdown Health facility data extraction template**

Please note that should you update your data during the workshop, ensure it is in the correct format before uploading to avoid errors.

## **Supported File Formats**

The app supports uploading the following file types:

-   `.xls`, `.xlsx` (Excel files)- The raw health facility dataset in the **Countdown data template**

-   `.dta` (Stata files) - Master dataset downloaded from the app after validation/adjustment

-   `.rds` (R Cached datafile) - The file containing the preloaded dataset, user adjustments and analysis parameters that has been \> saved in the Cache directory. This will be the last saved file.

## **How to Upload Data**

**Step 1: Prepare your data file**

Ensure your data is cleaned and structured according to the **Countdown Health facility data (HFD)** template by:

-   Using the provided **HFD Standardized Template** to format your data correctly.

-   Saving the file in a supported format: `.xls`, `.xlsx`, .`dta`, or `.rds`.

Step 2: Upload the File

1.  Navigate to the `Upload Data` section of the app.

2.  **Drag and drop** your file into the upload box, or click **`Browse`** \> to select it manually in your directory.

3.  For subsequent re-uploads (after the initial uploading of the `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.dta` files and saving your progress in .rds file using the `Save Cache` button), do not re-upload the `.xls`, .`xlsx`, or `.dta` but the saved `.rds` file if you want to retain any changes made in your analytical files

4.  The app will validate your file against the **Countdown template**.

    -   If successful, a confirmation message will appear: ***"Upload successful: Your file is ready for analysis."***

    -   If errors are detected, an error message will indicate the issue.

## **Common Errors and How to Fix Them**

| **Error Message** | **Cause** | **Solution** |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| "Unsupported file format" | File type not supported | Save your file as .xls, .xlsx, .dta, or .rds. |
| "The following required columns are missing from the data: opv1" | Missing essential columns in the data | Add the missing column(s) to your dataset and ensure their values are valid. |
| "The following sheets are missing: Service_data_1, Service_data_2, Service_data_3, Reporting_completeness, Population_data, Admin_data" | Missing one or more required sheets in the file | Add the missing sheets to your file and ensure they conform to the template. |
| "Sheet Service_data_3 is empty" | The sheet exists but contains no data | Populate the sheet with valid data or remove the empty sheet. |
| "Key Columns "month" missing in Service_data_3" | A key column district, year, or month, is missing from the specified sheet | Add the missing column(s) to the sheet and ensure the data is structured correctly. |
| "Column name month must not be duplicated. Use .name_repair to specify repair." | Duplicate column names in the dataset | Ensure all column names are unique. Rename or remove duplicate columns. |

***Note**: If a key column (district, year, or month) is missing data in a row, that row will be excluded from the resulting dataset.*

## **Tips for a Successful Upload**

-   Always use the latest the **Countdown Health facility data template** \> template to structure your data.

-   Double-check column names, formats, and content before uploading.

-   Save your file in a supported format and ensure it is UTF-8 encoded
