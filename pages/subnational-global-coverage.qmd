# Sub-national Global coverage targets {#sec-subnat-coverage-targets}

### Rationale, Approach and implementation

Global initiatives such as EPMM, ENAP, and IA2030 define universal coverage goals to be achieved in **every** district, not just nationally. Tracking sub-national performance against these targets holds countries accountable and promotes equity.

Three global targets for coverage indicators are of particular interest:

-   ANC4: 80% of districts have at least 70% coverage (EPMM/ENAP)
-   SBA or institutional delivery: 80% of districts have at least 80% coverage (EPMM/ENAP)
-   Penta3/DTP3: at least 80% coverage in every district or equivalent administrative unit with three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis containing vaccines (DTP/pentavalent vaccine).

Progress towards international and national targets can be measured by computing the percentage of regions and districts that have achieved these targets. The goal is for all regions and districts to have met the target. Higher percentages mean less inequality.

The key statistical measure for sub-national inequalities are:

-   Percent of sub-national units with coverage above a specific target or threshold: this indicator provides information on the extent to which a country has been successful in reaching universal coverage at the sub-national level.

**Implementation: Conducting analysis in the Shiny App**

Navigate to the Sub-national **Analysis** tab **-\> Coverage Target** and select the Admin Level1 subnational unit of interest. Select the indicator group (Maternal Health or Vaccine indicators) and and inspect the percentage of districts within the selected sub-national unit that have achieved the global coverage targets.

Outputs will include Percent of regions and percent of districts that have achieved specific targets for ANC4, institutional deliveries and penta3 vaccination as shown below.
