# General introduction {#general-introduction}

The CD2030 for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health, GFF, UNICEF, WHO, WAHO and other partners are collaborating to strengthen country-led progress and performance reviews, such as annual health sector reviews and midterm reviews of investment cases. This guidebook is for Countdown country analytical teams to develop a set of national and subnational estimates for key RMNCAH-N indicators, including equity, using five-year time series of routine data and survey results. Much attention is paid to obtaining a clean data set with the necessary corrections and adjustments for known biases. Service coverage and equity, maternal and perinatal mortality, and health service utilization and systems performance are the main subjects, with a focus on monitoring national and subnational targets, as well as global targets.

There are eight data analysis topics. For each topic there is an explanation in this guidebook: *why* it is done, *what* the analysis is focusing on and *how* it is done with the analytical tool (R Shiny App) to obtain the desired outputs.

Each topic has several components:

-   **Data inputs:** country DHIS2 data (by month, district and indicator), household survey results (such as DHS and MICS), and global estimates of population and other indicators.

-   **Analytical tool**: (Shiny App): to analyse the data and produce outputs as Stata datasets (\*.dta), graphs or excel tables (\*.xlsx), reproducible analysis files (.rds files) and reports (.pdf, .doc files)

-   **Outputs:** Full report (.pdf, word (.doc) and Synthesis reports (.ppt), adjusted datasets, analytical files for reproducibility (.rds)

### Implementation: Conducting analysis in the Shiny App {#implementation-conducting-analysis-in-the-shiny-app}

# Section 1: Health facility data quality assessment {#section-1-health-facility-data-quality-assessment}

## Numerators Assessment {#numerators-assessment}

### Rationale: Scientific basis for the analysis {#rationale-scientific-basis-for-the-analysis}

Routinely reported health facility data are an important data source for health indicators at facility and population level. The data are reported by health facilities on events such as immunizations given, or live births attended. As with any data, quality is an issue. Data needs to be checked to consider completeness of reporting by health facilities, identify extreme outliers and internal consistency. A standard reporting method for data quality allows assessment of progress over time.

### Approach: Description of analytical steps {#approach-description-of-analytical-steps}

The analysis of the monthly data by district for 2019-2024 is used to assess annual data quality using the following standard indicators:

**Table 1: Health facility data quality assessment: numerators**

|   | **Indicator** | **Numerator** | **Denominator** | **Interpretation** |
|----|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | **Completeness of monthly facility reporting** | Statistics for 1a and 1b are based on the mean of 4 reporting forms (ANC, delivery, immunization, OPD) |  | Essential indicator for all analyses |
| 1a | \% of expected monthly facility reports (national) | N of monthly facility reports received | Total N of facility reports expected (usually 12\* N of facilities with the service) | Reporting rates over 90% are good; changes in reporting completeness over time affects trend analysis |
| 1b | \% of districts with completeness of facility reporting \>= 90% | N of districts with at least 90% monthly reporting completeness in a year | Total N of districts | Can be used to identify districts with low reporting rates in multiple years |
| 1c | \% of districts with no missing monthly values in a year for any of the 4 forms | N of districts with no missing values for any of the 4 forms in a year | Total N of districts | Additional indicator, is not used to compute the overall data quality score |
| **2** | **Extreme outliers** | The statistics for 2a and 2b are based on the mean of outliers in ANC, delivery, PNC, vaccination, OPD and IPD indicators |  | N of indicators included in the mean may vary according to countries |
| 2a | \% of monthly values that are not extreme outliers[^fullguide-1] (national) | N of monthly values that are not extreme outliers in a specific year | Total N of monthly values (usually 12 \* N years to be analyzed) | At least 99% of monthly data expected **not** to be an extreme outlier; consider reasons |
| 2b | \% of districts with no extreme outliers in a year | N of districts with no extreme outliers in a specific year | Total N of districts | At least 90% of districts should have no extreme outliers at all; consider reasons |
| **3** | **Consistency of annual reporting** |  |  |  |
| 3a | ANC1 to penta1 ratio in the reported data (national) | N of ANC1 reported | N of penta1 reported | National ratio within an expected range (1.05 to 1.10 if survey coverage ANC1 and penta1 are the same -- see below) |
| 3b | Penta1 to penta3 ratio in the reported data (national) | N of penta1 reported | N of penta3 reported | National ratio within an expected range, based on the survey results (see below) |
| 3c | \% of districts with ANC1-penta1 ratio between 1.0 and 1.5 | N of districts with ratios within the expected range | Total N of districts | For districts there is more variation in the ratio: a wider range is considered |
| 3d | \% of districts with penta1-penta3 ratio between 1.0 and 1.5 | N of districts within the expected range | Total N of districts | For districts there is more variation in the ratio: a wider range is considered |
| 4 | **Summary of performance** |  |  |  |
|  | Annual data quality score (mean 1a, 1b, 2a,2b, 3c,3d) |  |  |  |

[^fullguide-1]: An extreme outlier is defined as a monthly value that is 5 times the median absolute deviation (MAD) from monthly median value for a particular year.

There is often an inconsistency between antenatal and immunization data, even though we can argue that the two should be consistent. To examine the association between ANC1 and penta1 is particularly informative. To compute and interpret indicators 3a and 3b the following considerations need to be made:

***ANC1 to penta1 ratio***

We can compute an expected ratio ANC1 to penta1 based on assumptions about mortality between early to mid pregnancy and early infancy and survey data on coverage of ANC1 and penta1 in the population:

-   Consider the mortality between the first ANC visit and the first pentavalent vaccination.

> Assuming that ANC1 takes place at about 20 weeks or 4-5 months of pregnancy and penta1 at 6-8 weeks postpartum, we assume a pregnancy loss (abortion) after the ANC1 visit of 3%, a stillbirth rate of 2%, a twinning rate of 1.5% and neonatal mortality rate before the penta1 of 3% then the difference between the numbers of ANC1 and penta1 should be: 1 -- 0.03 -- 0.02 + 0.015 -- 0.03 = 0.935. This corresponds with a ANC1 to penta1 ratio of 1/0.935 = 1.07.

-   Actual population coverage of ANC1 and penta1 will also need to be considered, using the surveys.

> The expected ratio (the number of ANC1/ number of penta1 in facilities) is 1.07 \* (ANC1 coverage in the survey/penta1 coverage in the survey).
>
> If coverage for ANC1 and penta1 are the same, then the ratio is 1.07 (1.07 \* 1/1). But if, for example, the last survey shows that ANC1 coverage was 90% and penta1 coverage was 95%, then the expected ratio becomes 1.07 \* (.90/.95) = 1.01.

-   For the national ANC1 to penta1 ratio a range of plus or minus 0.05 outside this computed ratio is considered acceptable. If the ratio is outside this range, this should be flagged, and possible explanations discussed.

***Penta1 to penta3 ratio***

We can compute an expected penta1 to penta3 ratio based on the most recent survey:

-   The main factor determining the penta1 to penta3 ratio, which are recommended at 6 and at 14 weeks of age, is the actual drop-out rate between penta1 and penta3, as mortality plays a limited role.

-   Population coverage rates from the latest survey are used to determine the expected penta1 to penta3 ratio in the facility data. For instance, if penta1 coverage is 95% and penta3 coverage is 85%, we expect that ratio to be 0.95/0.85 = 1.12.

-   Also, here a range of plus or minus 0.05 is considered acceptable for the assessment of the facility data.

**Report:**

Points to consider for the interpretation

-   Is there a data quality pattern by year for which there is an \> explanation? (include the explanation)

-   Are there certain regions or other subnational units that are \> particularly problematic?

-   Are there certain reporting forms or services (e.g., antenatal care, \> labour and delivery, immunization) that are problematic?

-   Is there good consistency between reported numbers of ANC1 and \> penta1?

The Figure below produced in the ShinyApp shows the ratios for all six years (2019-2024) and the expected value. It will be important to reflect on large differences (e.g., more than 0.10 or 10%.).

## Numerator adjustments {#numerator-adjustments}

### Rationale: Scientific basis for the analysis {#rationale-scientific-basis-for-the-analysis-1}

The completeness of reporting may affect the analysis, especially if completeness is low or varies between years. Extreme outliers, such as an accidental extra zero in a number, can have a large impact, especially on subnational numbers. Following the assessments, several steps are necessary to obtain a clean data set for analysis. This implies adjusting for incomplete reporting and correcting for extreme outliers.

### Approach: Description of analytical steps {#approach-description-of-analytical-steps-1}

If we do not consider reporting completeness that means we assume all non-reporting facilities provided zero services, which is not likely to be true. Adjustments depend on how much services (e.g., pregnancy care, vaccinations) were provided at non-reporting facilities compared to those that reported. The insert below shows how the adjustment factor k is used to adjust the reported numbers for incomplete reporting. As a default value, we use k=0.25, which means the non-reporting facilities provided services but only at a volume which was a quarter of the reporting health facilities. The factor k can be different for different services. For instance, if private facility reporting is poor but they are in the national system and they provide a considerable number of deliveries, k maybe greater than 0.25 or even as high as 1.0. If the facility reporting rate is below 75%, it becomes more difficult to impute district data. Therefore, no adjustments are made if reporting is lower than 75%. In that case, further analysis to determine coverage with the facility data is not considered sufficiently reliable.

![](vertopal_f4f609e4c40f4b16b7a99c641e5be419/media/image13.png){width="5.13346675415573in" height="2.0645461504811897in"}

Extreme outliers, as defined in the previous section, will be corrected by imputing the median monthly value of the same year. The table summarizes the adjustments.

**Table 2: Summary of adjustments made to the raw health facility data in preparation of a clean data set for the endline analysis**

| **Problem** | **Action** | **Adjustment** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Low reporting rates: identifying low rates that were adjusted | If below 75% (default), data were imputed | Median monthly value for the district year was imputed for the month with low reporting |
| Incomplete reporting by districts, variable over time, affecting trend assessment | If reporting rates were \>=75% and \<= 100% default), an assumption was made about the volume of services provided by the non-reporting facilities | Adjustment factor k value was used to adjust for incomplete reporting k default value 0.25 (replace if different value used; state if used for all reporting forms or different k factors between forms) |
| Extreme outliers can greatly affect coverage trend assessments | If a monthly value was greater or smaller than 5 times the median absolute deviation (MAD) from district monthly median value, an adjustment was made | Extreme monthly outliers are corrected and given the district median value for the same year |
| Missing values | If there is a missing value, data were imputed | District median monthly value for the year was imputed for the month with missing value |

### Implementation: Conducting analysis in the Shiny App {#implementation-conducting-analysis-in-the-shiny-app-1}

-   The outputs for this analysis can be obtained by running a **Data adjustment section**

> **(Remove Years** section before this, allows you to remove any years with no data or whose data has been determined to be not fit for analysis by the country team due to quality issues).
>

-   This Section produces a master adjusted dataset (.dta) ready for analysis and plots for different indicators showing data adjustment changes.

**Report**

-   The interpretation should include the selected adjustment factor \> (factor k) that was used to adjust for incomplete reporting (if \> necessary, by service). If the default factor is used, then report \> this and explain what this means for the reader.

-   Report the percent change that the adjustment made in reported \> numbers of institutional deliveries and in penta1 (average of the \> 5-year period); you may want to highlight the year with the \> greatest impact of the adjustment if there is one; interpret if \> the impact of the adjustment on coverage rates is large or small; \> Make the same description and interpretations for penta1 \> vaccinations.

## Denominator assessment and selection {#denominator-assessment-and-selection}

### Rationale: Scientific basis for the analysis {#rationale-scientific-basis-for-the-analysis-2}

Service coverage is defined as the population who received the service divided by the population who need the services (also referred to as target population). The numerators of coverage statistics (e.g., number of live births in health facilities) are derived from the health facility data and need to be adjusted as shown in the previous section. The denominator of the coverage statistics (e.g., number of live births in the population) needs to be estimated for national and subnational levels (regions/provinces and districts).

### Approach: Description of analytical steps {#approach-description-of-analytical-steps-2}

The objective of the health facility denominator analysis is twofold. First, we assess the quality of the population projections in DHIS2 by comparison with the UN projections and the internal consistency. Then, we assess the performance of multiple denominators options for the computation of population-based service coverage indicators from the health facility data. This should lead to a final decision on denominators that are used for the analyses of population-based coverage indicators based on health facility data.

Each indicator has its own denominator, as shown in the table below.

**Table 3: Selected indicators with numerators and denominators**

| **Indicators** | **Numerator** | **Denominator** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **SERVICE UTILIZATION** |  |  |
| Outpatient visits, children under 5, per year (N) | N of OPD visits for under-5 | Total mid-year population under 5 |
| Inpatient admissions, children under 5, per year (N) | N of admissions for under-5 | Total mid-year population under 5 |
| **PREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS** |  |  |
| \% of pregnant women with 4 antenatal care visits | N of women with ANC 4th visit | Total N of pregnant women in the whole population |
| \% of live births in health facilities | N of live births in health facilities | Total N of live births in the whole population |
| \% of infants receiving 3 doses of pentavalent vaccine | N of infants receiving 3 doses | N of infants eligible for 3 doses of the vaccine |
| **CURATIVE INTERVENTIONS** |  |  |
| \% of children under 5 with malaria who receive ACT | N of children under 5 with malaria receiving ACT | Total N of children who had malaria in the last year |
| \% of deliveries that were by C-section (population) | N of C-sections reported | Total N of deliveries in the population |
| \% of deliveries that were by C-section (institutional) | N of C-sections reported | Total N of deliveries in health facilities |
| **MORTALITY** |  |  |
| Institutional maternal mortality ratio | N of maternal deaths in health facilities | Total number of live births in health facilities |
| Stillbirth rate | N of stillbirths in health facilities | Total N of births in health facilities |
| Neonatal mortality before discharge | N of neonatal deaths before discharge (after birth) | Total N of live births in the health facilities |
| **FAMILY PLANNING (FP)** |  |  |
| Ratio FP visits to women of reproductive age | N of FP new and revisits | Total N of women 15-49 years |
| Estimated modern use of contraceptives | Couple years of protection | Total N of women 15-49 years |
| FP coverage (demand satisfied) | N of women using modern methods | Total N of women in need of FP |

In the first part, we assess the **quality of the DHIS2 population projections** at national level:

-   **Check the internal consistency of the DHIS2 population growth over time:**

    -   Compute the population growth rate:

        $$
        \frac{\text{pop}_{2024} - \text{pop}_{2023}}{\text{pop}_{2023}}
        $$

    -   Compute the crude birth rate (CBR), defined as the number of live births per 1,000 population.

    -   Expect both growth rate and CBR to be consistent over time (e.g., less than 2 per 1,000 difference between years).

-   **Compare the population data in DHIS2 with the UN population projections at the national level:**

    -   Differences may occur, but large discrepancies suggest issues with DHIS2 population projections.

    -   The comparison is done for four indicators. Abnormal values are flagged:

        -   **Population size:**\
            A relative difference between DHIS2 and UN-projected population size greater than 5% indicates a data quality issue.

            $$
            \left| \frac{\text{pop}_{\text{DHIS2}} - \text{pop}_{\text{UN}}}{\text{pop}_{\text{UN}}} \right|
            $$

        -   **Population growth during 2023–2024:**\
            Annual growth is computed using the natural logarithm:

            $$
            \ln \left( \frac{\text{pop}_{2024}}{\text{pop}_{2023}} \right)
            $$

            A difference greater than 0.3% (absolute) between DHIS2 and UN estimates is concerning.

        -   **Crude birth rate (CBR):**\
            Defined as:

            $$
            \frac{\text{projected live births}}{\text{total population}} \times 1000
            $$

            A difference greater than 5 per 1,000 population compared to the UN estimate suggests a data quality issue.

        -   **Crude death rate (CDR):**\
            Defined as:

            $$
            \text{CBR} - \text{population growth rate}
            $$

            (both expressed per 1,000 population). A **negative CDR** or a **CDR \< 5 per 1,000** indicates inconsistency and potential data problems.

The second part is to select the best performing denominator for population coverage estimates with facility data. First, we compare the results for different denominators at the national level. For the national level, we evaluate 4 denominator methods. The first two are projection methods - DHIS2 estimate and UN estimate. In addition, 2 facility data derived methods are used: ANC1-derived and penta1-derived denominators. The box below describes the facility data derived method. For the subnational level, no UN projections are available, so we will use 3 methods only.

The maternal and newborn health denominators are closely related and can be computed from each other by making assumptions. Starting with pregnancies, the number of live births is closely associated with the number of pregnancies, which are usually identified within the health system at the first antenatal visit which in most countries is around 4-5 months of pregnancy (according to the surveys). Country specific values are preferred where available. The default assumptions are as follows -:

-   Pregnancy loss between 4 and 7 months (28 weeks of pregnancy): 3%.

-   Stillbirths or pregnancy loss between 28 weeks and birth: 2%.

-   Twinning rate: 1.5%. These first three steps give the number of live births computed from pregnancies.

-   Neonatal mortality: 3% (or 30 per 1,000 live births).

-   Post neonatal mortality (between 1-11 months): 2.4% (or 24 per 1,000 live births).

The selection of the best performing denominator method is based on a comparison of the performance of the DHIS2 projection and facility-data derived methods for two indicators: institutional live births and penta3. The gold standard is the population coverage rates from a recent survey, for a year as close as possible. The absolute difference between survey and facility-based coverage at national and subnational levels is used to select the best performing indicator. (This can also be expressed as the number of standard errors from the survey value but this requires including the standard errors from the surveys -- the results will be the same).

**Box -- Facility data derived denominators**

The basic idea is that if the coverage of an indicator is high (e.g., over 90%), then the number of events reported by health facilities has to be close to the target population. In other words, the denominators or target population can be derived from the numbers in DHIS2. The best candidate indicators for this approach are ANC1 and DPT/penta1 (BCG also possible in some countries if re-vaccinations are recorded separately).

This approach requires the following:

-   A recent population-based survey is used to obtain an estimate of population level coverage of ANC1 or penta1.[^fullguide-2] For example, ANC1 coverage is 95% of pregnant women.

-   The DHIS2 data on the number of ANC1 and penta1 visits need to be considered complete and accurate (after adjustments / cleaning the data). For example, 100,000 ANC1 visits were reported.

-   If this is the case, then we only need to add the percentage that has not used the services (according to the survey results) to get the target population. For example, if ANC1 coverage from survey is 95% and the number of ANC1 visits from DHIS2 for the year is 100,000, the total number of pregnant women is: 100,000 / 0.95 = 105,263 pregnant women

-   The same approach can be used for DPT1 or penta1. The survey coverage is the percent of children 12-23 months who received DPT1/penta1, the facility data are the number of infants who received DPT1/penta1 vaccination. For example, if survey coverage is 92%, and there were 100,000 vaccinations given, then the denominator or target population = 100,000 / 0.92 = 108,696.

[^fullguide-2]: ANC1 in surveys is defined as percent of live births (on past 2-3 years) for which the pregnancy had at least one ANC visit ANC1 in facility data refers pregnant women making their first visit, irrespective of whether they will eventually get a live birth (first visit, on average 4-5 months)

The number of live births can be obtained from ANC1 and DPT1 by making assumptions about pregnancy loss (abortion after the first ANC visit, stillbirths), twinning rates, and neonatal mortality. The steps are shown in the Figures below. An example of ANC1:

-   above we computed 105,263 pregnant women in the population

-   at 3% abortion, this implies 105,263 \* (1-.0.03) = 102,454 deliveries

-   at 1.5% twinning rate this implies 102,454 / (1-(0.015/2)) = 103,229 births

-   at 2% stillbirth rate this implies 103,229 \* (1-0.02) = 101,164 live births

-   at 3% neonatal mortality this implies 101,164 \* (1-0.03) = 98,129 children eligible for DPT1/penta1.

### Implementation: Conducting analysis in the Shiny App {#implementation-conducting-analysis-in-the-shiny-app-2}

**Shiny App**

-   To get outputs for this analysis first, one need to set up their analysis by inputting key information at the **Analysis set up section**

> These include:

1.  National rates required for denominator calculation from surveys \> (ANC1 coverage, Penta1 coverage, Pregnancy loss rate, Twin Rate, \> Neonatal Mortality rate, Post neonatal Mortality rate and \> Stillbirth rate).

-   The first part is to assess the accuracy and consistency of the projected population numbers in the DHIS-2 by comparing them to external sources.

-   The second part is to compare results from the different methods - both at the national and subnational levels.

<!-- -->

-   The final step is to select the best performing denominator for the coverage analyses with health facility data. The results on the national gap and the median subnational gap should be taken into account to make that choice. The best methods have the smallest gaps with the survey results. Ideally, one method is selected but it is also possible to select one denominator method for the MNH coverage indicators (ANC, delivery, PNC) and another method for the immunization coverage analyses. It will be important to clearly state the chosen denominator method in all tables.

<!-- -->

-   The interpretation should focus on the extent to which the DHIS2 projections are considered robust which is the case when:

1)  The DHIS2 total population projection is consistent over time with \> regular population growth

2)  The DHIS2 total live birth projection is consistent over time \> (regular trend)

3)  The projected numbers of total population and live births are close \> to the UN population projection

4)  The DHIS2 population projections are consistent with UN estimates \> for crude birth rate and crude death rate.

-   The interpretation should describe, based on the graphs:

    -   Which denominator methods performed best at the national level \> for the two indicators?

    -   Which denominator performed best at the subnational level for \> the two indicators?

    -   What selection is made for the indicators in the coverage \> analyses?

# Section 2: National Analyses (Coverage & Equity) {#section-2-national-analyses-coverage-equity}

## Coverage of interventions {#coverage-of-interventions}

### Rationale: Scientific basis for the analysis {#rationale-scientific-basis-for-the-analysis-3}

Coverage of interventions is a critical and direct output of health systems. Regular tracking of coverage at national and subnational levels has become the mainstay of monitoring progress in national health plans and international initiatives. Reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health indicators with targets are the most common indicators of national health plans and global monitoring. Both health facility data and household surveys can provide coverage statistics, and an integrated analytical approach is desirable.

### Approach: Description of analytical steps {#approach-description-of-analytical-steps-3}

Many coverage indicators can be estimated in both surveys and from health facility data. Both are critical pieces of information and need to be considered in conjunction with each other. The Table below lists the indicators, for antenatal and delivery care and child immunization, considered in the health facility data analysis in the workshop, including the variable names (in R) in the first column.

The facility data can be used to generate annual coverage estimates, using the dataset for 2019-2024, through the Shiny App developed. These coverage results should be compared and interpreted alongside the results from recent surveys. The analysis results will include both coverage estimates.

### Implementation: Conducting analysis in the Shiny App {#implementation-conducting-analysis-in-the-shiny-app-3}

#### Antenatal care (ANC) {#antenatal-care-anc}

Most countries have at least one ANC indicator with a target in the national plan. The global ENAP/EPMM coverage targets for 2025 are: globally, at least 90% of pregnant women with 4 or more ANC care visits, and 90% of countries with at least 70% coverage. There are several ANC indicators that capture:

-   *contact with health services* during pregnancy (ANC 1^st^ visit, ANC 4 or more visits, ANC first visit in first trimester). ANC1 is often considered an indicator of basic access to health services. It is high in most countries, and in many instances, the numbers of ANC1 visits in the routine health facility data can provide a better denominator for the ANC and delivery indicators than population projections (see section 2 on denominators).

-   *contents of services* provided (intermittent preventive therapy (IPT2 or IPT3) against malaria, HIV testing, syphilis testing and iron-folic acid (IFA) supplementation (at least 90 tablets given to the pregnant woman)). Some countries will not have policies for all of these diagnostic or therapeutic interventions during pregnancy (e.g., no IPT if no malaria risk).

For most indicators, the surveys also provide coverage estimates for the national level, with 95% confidence intervals. For most coverage indicators the data refer to a period before the survey: e.g., institutional birth coverage for the live births in the two years preceding the survey. This means that the midpoint of the coverage estimate lies one year before the survey.

An example of two graphs for ANC, based on facility and survey data, is shown below, showing both good concordance between the facility-based and survey results for coverage of ANC first visit in the first trimester and poor concordance in case of ANC4 visits. In the latter case, it is evident that ANC4 is overreported in the facility data as coverage is much higher than the survey and unlikely to be high (over 90% during 2021-23 and even 101% in 2023). Poor recording and reporting of ANC 4^th^ visits in the DHIS2 data is likely the main cause.

Sometimes, an indicator may reach an unlikely high coverage at the national level, say over 125%. This may be because the data quality of the numerator of the coverage indicator is poor, the denominator is wrong, or the intervention is given and recorded more than once during pregnancy. An example is IFA supplementation. In that case, the computation of coverage is not useful. It is better to express it differently. For instance, if coverage is 200%, it is better to compute the average number of courses of 90 IFA tablets that a pregnant woman received (in this case 2.0 per pregnant woman in the population).[^fullguide-3]

[^fullguide-3]: Surveys can provide coverage of IFA supplementation, as here the unit of data analysis is individual pregnant women.

#### Delivery care {#delivery-care}

All countries have at least one delivery care indicator with a target in the national plan. The global ENAP/EPMM coverage target for 2025 is at least 90% global average coverage, and 90% of countries at least 80% coverage of skilled birth attendance (SBA). For postnatal care (PNC) within 2 days the global coverage target is 80% and the 90% of countries with at least 60% coverage.

*Institutional (live) birth coverage and SBA* are closely related, as almost all deliveries with a skilled attendant occur in health facilities. From the analytical point of view, institutional birth coverage is preferred because it is a more objective measure and avoids issues with the definition of what constitutes skilled birth. SBA is often preferred from the health care perspective, as it includes an element of quality: obviously, an institutional delivery without skilled attendance is not desirable, and in some countries home SBA may be part of the health care delivery strategy. attendance. Either indicator works well to capture delivery care.

*Caesarean section* is a live saving intervention and an important indicator. A general rule of thumb is, put forward by WHO, that in a population the need for Caesarean section is in the range of 10-15% of all deliveries. If the Caesarean section rate is below 10%, that means that there is unmet need. If the Caesarean section rate is over 10-15%, that implies that there most likely overuse of Caesarean section. It may however also imply that there is still unmet need among certain population groups (e.g. the poorest women or rural women) in combination with overuse in other subgroups of the population (such as urban and richer women).

*Postnatal care (PNC) within 48 hours* is provided to the mother/women and newborn. Country systems may have different ways of recording the type of PNC and also surveys are known to have data issues with PNC for the mother or the baby.[^fullguide-4] Some countries use multiple definitions of timing of the PNC visit (e.g., within the first week).

[^fullguide-4]: Amouzou A, Hazel E, Vaz L, Sanni Y, Moran A. Discordance in postnatal care between mothers and newborns: Measurement artifact or missed opportunity? J Glob Health. 2020 Jun;10(1):010505.

*Low birthweight* is a critical indicator of neonatal health. It is most meaningful if the distinction between prematurity and small-for-gestational age is made, but most facility reporting systems and most surveys do not have such data. All babies are supposed to have been weighed right after birth and the percent of newborns weighing less than 2500 grams is usually reported in the DHIS2 system. As general guidance for the interpretation of the data, low birthweight prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 13.9% (95% credibility interval: 12.4-15.7%) for 2020.[^fullguide-5]

[^fullguide-5]: Okwaraji YB, et al. National, regional, and global estimates of low birthweight in 2020, with trends from 2000: a systematic analysis. Lancet. 2024 Mar 16;403(10431):1071-1080.

#### Immunization {#immunization}

Immunization coverage indicators are included in virtually every country's health sector monitoring plan. A general target is at least 90% coverage for essential vaccines given in childhood and adolescence.

For the national coverage analyses, the focus is on BCG, first and third doses of penta/DTP (penta1 or DTP1 and penta3 or DTP3), and first and second doses of measles vaccine, often given in combination with rubella vaccine. *BCG and penta/DTP vaccinations* are recommended to be given at birth (BCG), 6 weeks (penta1) and 14 weeks (penta3). For facility data, the number of vaccinations given to infants is used and the denominator is the number of eligible children in the population, which is approximated as live births minus neonatal deaths. Survey data generally provide vaccination coverage among children 12-23 months (may also include the age at which the vaccination was given -- mostly before the first birthday).[^fullguide-6]

[^fullguide-6]: Therefore, the survey data on immunization roughly refer to the program performance in the year before the survey

The first dose of measles vaccine is generally recommended at age 9 months. For the facility data, the recording and reporting usually separate measles given to children under 1 year and children 1 year and older, though the quality of recording and reporting for the age group may vary (there may be a tendency to record measles vaccinations after 12 months as given to infants). Here, we use children who have survived the first year of life (live births minus neonatal deaths minus postneonatal deaths) as the denominator for measuring vaccination coverage. The second dose of measles uses children aged 24-35 months as denominator. This can be estimated as live births minus neonatal deaths = 2\* postneonatal deaths).

WHO and UNICEF work with countries to produce annual estimates of immunization coverage based on all data sources. The national estimates, called WUENIC, are published and available for 2020-2024. These time trends are included in the Stata outputs, to compare the 2019-2023 annual estimates of the facility data produced in the workshop and the survey results.

#### Family planning {#family-planning}

The family planning coverage estimates are derived from a collaboration of the Countdown with Track20. Track20 has developed an advanced estimation tool called Family Planning Estimation Tool (FPET) which focuses on three indicators: modern contraceptive use, unmet need for modern contraceptives and demand satisfied with modern methods. The three indicators are closely related since demand is satisfied (this is the true coverage indicator) = use of modern contraceptives / (unmet need + use of modern contraceptives).

FPET uses statistical modelling that incorporates all available data from surveys and may also use estimates obtained from facility data if the quality is sufficient.[^fullguide-7] FPET allows for various types of survey data to be integrated into the estimates and fits a line that pulls from the trends. This utilizes the strength of multiple data points and minimizes the risk of comparing different surveys.

## Equity Analysis (Survey data) {#equity-analysis-survey-data}

### Rationale: Scientific basis for the analysis {#rationale-scientific-basis-for-the-analysis-4}

**Equiplots**

Household surveys provide critical information on inequalities. Our focus is on three major dimensions of inequality: area of residence, wealth and education. For area of residence, we focus on urban/rural areas, for wealth, we use household wealth quintiles and for education we focus on education of the mother. Equiplots are used to assess whether the country has made progress since 2010 in reducing the poor rich gap or the gap between women with no education or low education and women with higher education.

For wealth quintiles, it can be assessed what the type of inequality is, as all categories are of the same size:

1)  If the richest are well ahead of all other wealth quintiles, this is \> top inequality and is sometimes also referred to as mass \> deprivation (only the rich escape)

2)  If the coverage differences are equidistant, this is a linear \> pattern where the increasing household wealth is linearly \> associated with higher coverage

3)  If the poorest are left behind, this is called bottom inequality, \> and means marginalization of the poorest. Each pattern requires a \> different strategy of health programming and targeting.

The interpretation should focus on whether inequalities have reduced over time and to what extent global targets for coverage have been met.

The following questions should guide and be answered by the interpretation:

1)  What is the level of inequality in the most recent data point?

2)  How have inequalities changed over time?

3)  Is there any inequality pattern that can be observed?

4)  What will be the best approaches to reduce inequalities?

**Maps**

Mapping is a powerful approach for visualizing geographical inequalities in health indicators, particularly useful at regional, provincial, or district levels. It effectively summarizes disparities across many administrative units when these differences are substantial.

Before developing a map, the following considerations are crucial:

1.  Inspect the range of indicator values across administrative units \> before mapping.

2.  Check the map's legend after creation, and avoid using maps if \> legend intervals reflect only minor differences, as this could \> mislead readers about the magnitude of inequalities.

3.  While maps can also illustrate changes in geographical inequalities \> over time, it is important to ensure such changes are substantial \> enough to warrant visualization.

### Approach: Description of analytical steps {#approach-description-of-analytical-steps-4}

The inequalities can be computed indicator by indicator. To obtain a general comprehensive overview of inequalities the Countdown introduced a Composite Coverage Index (CCI) which include family planning (demand satisfied with modern methods), maternal and newborn care (ANC 4^th^ visit and institutional delivery coverage), immunization (BCG, penta/DTP3 and measles) and treatment seeking behaviour for sick children (ORS for diarrhoea, facility visits for respiratory illness).[^fullguide-8]

## Further analysis of maternal and newborn care {#further-analysis-of-maternal-and-newborn-care}

In most countries, the coverage of births by health facilities has increased substantially during the past decade. The Countdown MNH multi-country analysis project looked further into this subject in the following ways:

-   In what types of health facilities do women deliver? Using the last two national surveys, the percentage of deliveries that occurred in hospitals, lower-level facilities or at home (and by public or private facility ownership) was examined. This is important to inform MNH strategies, as eventually all women should deliver in health facilities that have some level of emergency care capacity for women and newborns. Hospitals are more likely to have such capacity than lower-level facilities. The extent to which facilities provide C-sections is a good measure of this capacity as well.

-   What is the volume of deliveries and C-sections in the facilities by type of facility? This information was obtained from the country's HMIS/DHIS2 2022 data by facility, after quality assessments for completeness, missingness, outliers, and consistency of total births = stillbirths + livebirths. In general, health facilities with low volumes (less than 100 births per year) are considered to be less likely to provide high quality care. Similarly, it can be assessed by the proportion of facilities (by type) that have a low (less than 50 per year) or high volume of C-sections (at least 50 per year).

The main purpose of this analysis is to assess whether the increase in health facility deliveries has occurred primarily in lower-level facilities, with smaller volumes of deliveries and with little C-section capacity. For CAM 2024, the data from the multi-country study was summarized into one table (Table 3e) to highlight and interpret these findings. Further use and interpretation of these data in the context of the broader MNH study report and CAM data on MNH outcomes can inform discussions about the best MNH service delivery strategies in the context of the SDG 2030 targets for maternal mortality, stillbirth and neonatal mortality.

In most countries, the coverage of births by health facilities has increased substantially during the past decade. The Countdown MNH multi-country analysis project looked further into this subject in the following ways:

In general, health facilities with small volumes (less than 50 births per year) are considered to be less likely to provide high quality care. This information was obtained from the DHIS2 data by facility and gives insights into the volumes of hospitals and lower-level health facilities. Similarly, it can be assessed what proportion of facilities (by type) have a low (less than 50 per year) or high volume of C-sections (at least 100 per year).

The main purpose of this analysis is to assess whether the increase in health facility deliveries has occurred primarily in lower-level facilities, with smaller volumes of deliveries and with little C-section capacity. In any case, the data inform the discussion about the best MNH service delivery strategy in the context of the SDG 2030 targets for maternal, stillbirth and neonatal mortality.

**How?**

Stata code 3 generates coverage estimates for the indicators of interest. Each Stata run produces a graph and an Excel table for a specific indicator. For example, graph *csection_survey_dhis2.gph* and table *T3_csection_survey_dhis2.xlsx*. All graphs and tables include both the survey estimates (with 95% confidence intervals) and the facility-based estimates. For immunization the graph and table also provide the UN (WUENIC) coverage estimates for 2019-2022 (the file WUENIC_estimates should be located in the same directory as the master files for Stata to include the UN estimates).

All outputs can be imported into the Workbook and be further examined and analysed in the sheets T3a-3c in the workbook. A selection can be imported into the Chartbook as **Table 3a** (ANC indicators), **Table 3b** (delivery care and PNC indicators, plus low birthweight) and **Table 3c** (child immunization). The Stata, where interpretations of the trends should be given:

-   First address data quality: Are the levels and trends plausible? Is there good consistency between the facility and survey data?

-   Then, interpret the data if there is sufficient confidence in the observed levels and trends. How does the coverage perform compared to the targets? Is this a positive trend? Are there explanations for the observed levels and trends?

The FP output for **Table 3d** and the Workbook is derived from the 2023 Track20 workshop, preceding the CAM. It is proposed to include up to two slides in the final Chartbook, with a focus on national trends and their intepretation.

Section 3: Subnational analysis (Coverage & Inequality)

## Coverage of Interventions (Admin level 2) {#coverage-of-interventions-admin-level-2}

### Rationale: Scientific basis for the analysis {#rationale-scientific-basis-for-the-analysis-5}

Equity analysis goes beyond geography, encompassing multiple dimensions such as socio-economic status (e.g., household wealth and education), demographic factors (e.g., maternal age, parity, sex of the child), and place of residence (e.g., urban vs. rural). Subnational monitoring complements individual- and household-level equity assessments by highlighting spatial disparities. Some national health plans now include equity-specific targets for key indicators, making subnational analysis critical not only for tracking progress but also for informing more inclusive, equitable policy and programming.

### Approach: Description of analytical steps {#approach-description-of-analytical-steps-5}

The analyses will consider the equity issue from two angles. The first uses the health facility data by region/province and by district for selected indicators. The second assesses socioeconomic inequalities for selected indicators using survey data.

### Implementation: Conducting analysis in the Shiny App {#implementation-conducting-analysis-in-the-shiny-app-4}

## Inequality: Health facility data {#inequality-health-facility-data}

### Rationale: Scientific basis for the analysis {#rationale-scientific-basis-for-the-analysis-6}

Subnational analysis of health intervention coverage is essential for advancing universal health coverage (UHC), which aims to ensure equitable access to quality health services for all populations. National averages often mask critical disparities that exist across regions, districts, or population subgroups. Monitoring subnational data helps identify geographical areas where coverage is low, signaling potential inequities in health service access and prompting targeted interventions. This is particularly important for drawing attention to populations who are left behind and ensuring resources are directed where they are most needed.

### Approach: Description of analytical steps {#approach-description-of-analytical-steps-6}

The focus should be on assessing the extent to which the country programs have succeeded in reducing the inequalities between regions/provinces and between districts, and the extent to which districts have reached a coverage target. Three global targets for coverage indicators are of particular interest:

-   ANC4: 80% of districts have at least 70% coverage (EPMM/ENAP)

-   SBA or institutional delivery: 80% of districts have at least 80% coverage (EPMM/ENAP)

-   Penta3/DTP3: at least 80% coverage in every district or equivalent administrative unit with three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis containing vaccines (DTP -- or pentavalent vaccine).

The regional and district analyses should use the best performing denominator for the coverage computations, as decided from the analysis in section 2 on denominators. There will be more "noise" in the subnational data with improbably high or low coverage rates, compared to the national analyses, and more so in the district analyses than in the regional (admin1) analyses. This is because district analyses are affected by small numbers (more fluctuations which may be random or due to data quality issues) and by the health service utilization patterns by women and children. For instance, a municipal district may get more deliveries than an adjacent rural district because of the location of the hospitals in the municipal district.

The key statistical measures for subnational inequalities are:

-   MADM: median absolute distance from the median. This measure gives an indication on whether the country has been successful in reducing inequalities between subnational units.

-   Percent of subnational units with coverage above a specific target or threshold: this indicator provides information on the extent to which a country has been successful in reaching universal coverage at the subnational level.

*Summary of district and regional performance*

Progress towards international and national targets can be measured by computing the percentage of regions and districts that have achieved these targets. The goal is for all regions and districts to have met the target. Higher percentages mean less inequality.

### Implementation: Conducting analysis in the Shiny App {#implementation-conducting-analysis-in-the-shiny-app-5}

**Percent of regions and percent of districts that have achieved specific targets for ANC4, institutional deliveries and penta3 vaccination**

![](vertopal_f4f609e4c40f4b16b7a99c641e5be419/media/image28.png){width="3.216484033245844in" height="1.8592443132108487in"}![](vertopal_f4f609e4c40f4b16b7a99c641e5be419/media/image31.png){width="3.0490299650043746in" height="1.8681299212598426in"}

Further analyses may also include plotting of regional or district results by year, with the median absolute distance from the median (MADM, see below), as the summary measure to assess if inequalities have reduced.

*Subnational coverage using an index*

To summarize the coverage situation according to the health facility statistics for 2024 can be done for the regional level and shown on a map. A composite coverage index is computed as an average in seven mother and child health indicators: ANC4, institutional live birth coverage, SBA, IPT2, postnatal care, pentavalent vaccine 3^rd^ dosage and measles vaccination coverage. Equal weight is given to all indicators.

![](vertopal_f4f609e4c40f4b16b7a99c641e5be419/media/image30.png){width="3.84588801399825in" height="3.182567804024497in"}

*Subnational statistical summaries*

The aim is to produce a one-pager for each admin1 unit (generally region, province or county) that contains the regional information as well as a summary of the districts within the region. We refer to this as a regional subnational statistical summary.

The following components are included:

-   Summary of key demographic information for the region and the districts: table with expected number of births in 2024 according to the DHIS2 projections and according to the preferred denominators derived from the health facility data (based on ANC1 for live births, and on penta1 for immunization indicators).

-   Line graphs with the trend in coverage of institutional deliveries and penta3 vaccination that include the best estimates for 2020-2024 based on the health facility data, as well as the estimates from the most recent surveys (from 2015) for the same indicators (with confidence intervals if possible).

-   Bar graphs that compare the 2024 coverage situation in the region compared to all other regions, and puts the region into the lowest, middle or upper third of regions in terms of coverage. This is done for both institutional deliveries and penta3 vaccination.

-   Table that summarizes the coverage for institutional deliveries and penta3 vaccination in 2024 by district.

-   Other indicators can be used as prioritized by the country (e.g., ANC4, measles1).

# Section 4: Maternal mortality, stillbirths and neonatal mortality {#section-4-maternal-mortality-stillbirths-and-neonatal-mortality}

### Rationale: Scientific basis for the analysis {#rationale-scientific-basis-for-the-analysis-7}

Maternal and perinatal mortality in health facilities are critical indicators of the quality of care (institutional mortality). Institutional maternal mortality is one of the key indicators proposed to monitor progress. Facility-based mortality statistics can also be a critical input into the estimation of population levels of mortality. Reporting of maternal deaths, stillbirths, and early neonatal deaths (before discharge) may occur through the routine reporting system (DHIS2, aggregate or individual level) or be part of a maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response system (MPDSR).[^fullguide-9]

[^fullguide-9]: The best method of reporting is death registration as part of a fully functioning civil registration and vital statistics system, but this is not available in most low- and lower-middle-income countries.

Population mortality statistics (maternal mortality ratio, stillbirth rates, neonatal mortality rates) rely on household surveys and censuses, with major limitations, especially for maternal mortality and stillbirths. A promising development is the major increase in health facility deliveries observed in many countries. Especially if coverage of births in health facilities is high (e.g., over 75%), the facility-based statistics will become a useful input into the estimation of population levels of mortality.

The main challenge with mortality data from health facilities is underreporting of deaths. Maternal deaths do not only occur during birth, but also in pregnancy and post-partum. Reporting of stillbirth deaths requires well maintained maternity registers, but also cross-checks to the operation theatre registers for cases of Caesarean section. If that is not the case, deaths may not be recorded in the maternity register, and not reported into the national system. In addition, maternal deaths occurring in other hospital wards are more likely to be missed, such as deaths associated with abortion, or post-discharge due to sepsis and other causes. Neonatal deaths after discharge, which is often within 24 hours, are also more likely to be missed. A critical step is a systematic assessment of data quality issues, which forms the basis for, if possible, adjustments, and more importantly should guide efforts to improve reporting quality.

### Approach: Description of analytical steps {#approach-description-of-analytical-steps-7}

The definitions for institutional, community and population maternal mortality and for stillbirths are:

| **Indicator** | **Numerator** | **Denominator** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Institutional maternal mortality ratio (iMMR) | Number of maternal deaths in health facilities[^fullguide-10] | Number of live births in health facilities \* 100,000 |
| Population maternal mortality (MMR) | Number of maternal deaths in the population | Number of live births in the population \* 100,000 |
| Community maternal mortality ratio (comer) | Number of maternal deaths in the community | Number of live births in the community \* 100,000 |
| Institutional stillbirth rate (iSBR) | Number of stillbirths in health facilities[^fullguide-11] | Number of births in health facilities \* 1,000 |
| Population stillbirth rate (SBR) | Number of stillbirths in the population | Number of births in the population \* 1,000 |
| Community stillbirth rate (cSBR) | Number of stillbirths in the community | Number of births in the community \* 1,000 |
| Neonatal mortality (before discharge) | Number of neonatal deaths before discharge | Number of live births in health facilities \* 1000 |

[^fullguide-10]: Maternal death is defined as any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes) during pregnancy and childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy

[^fullguide-11]: A baby who dies after 28 weeks of pregnancy, but before or during birth, is classified as a stillbirth. Often the distinction is made between ante-partum (macerated) and intrapartum (fresh) stillbirths.

Data analysis has the following components:

**1: Present and review the institutional maternal mortality ratio (iMMR) and stillbirth rates (iSBR)**

The annual mortality rates are computed using the unadjusted data on reported deaths and births/live births in health facilities. We do not adjust for reporting rates and outliers (as is done for other interventions) because it is difficult to adjust maternal deaths, and stillbirths, where the number of deaths is small and fluctuating.[^fullguide-12] It is however advisable to check the data for any extreme outliers in the annual data (e.g., numbers of deaths that clearly indicate data entry errors) and replace these with the average of the surrounding years.

[^fullguide-12]: It is however good to inspect the data and consider extreme outliers (more than 3 standard deviations from the annual, or more than 5 times the median absolute deviation -- see data quality section.

The figure (5a) displays the institutional maternal mortality per 100,000 live births for regions (dots) and for the country as a whole (line and annual values) by year.

Several considerations need to be made:

-   Are there any extreme outliers on the high side which may be due to major data errors which need correction

-   How many regions have implausibly low iMMR which is arbitrarily defined as less than 25 per 100,000 live births (25 is two times the MMR in high-income countries of 12.5); are these more advanced regions where mortality is expected to be lower, or are there less-developed regions with low mortality, which could be an indication of major underreporting of deaths.

-   A map with the iMMR by region/province would be a useful addition to guide the interpretation of the data, especially focusing on potential data quality issues.

**Figure 5a: Institutional maternal mortality ratio per 100,000 live births, by region (dots) and national (line), 2019-2024**

Figure 5c presents the stillbirth rate per 1,000 births for regions and the country, using the same format as for maternal mortality.

-   how many regions have implausibly low iSBR which is defined as less than 6 per 1,000 births (which is two times the SBR in high income countries); are these more advanced regions where mortality is expected to be lower, or is this a sign of major underreporting of deaths in less-developed regions of the country.

In addition, the institutional mortality levels can be compared to the most recent mortality estimates for the population. These population estimates could be coming from a recent national survey or census, or we can use the UN estimates for maternal mortality (for 2020) and stillbirth rates (for 2021). This is to obtain an idea of the difference between the institutional mortality and the population mortality.

-   How far is the iMMR (or iSBR) from the UN estimates of the population mortality, including the uncertainty range of the global estimates: this difference will be used further to assess the data quality.

The institutional neonatal mortality rates (per 1,000 live births) based on reported neonatal deaths may also be graphed similar to iMMR and iSBR, but have to be interpreted with additional caution. Almost all babies stay at least 24 hours after delivery in the hospital but after that many are discharged and the observation time in health facilities is variable. Therefore, the statistic is mostly referred to as neonatal deaths before discharge per 1,000 live births, which includes day 1, some deaths on day 2, fewer deaths on day 3 etc. A rough guide to assess reporting completeness is that expected mortality of neonatal deaths before discharge in health facilities should be at least half of neonatal mortality in the population.[^fullguide-13] So for instance, if population neonatal mortality is 20 per 1,000 live births, we expect institutional neonatal mortality at least 10 per 1,000 live births in the health facilities.

[^fullguide-13]: A rough guide is that 75-80% of all neonatal deaths occur in the first week of life. Within the first week about 60-70% of deaths take place in the first 24 hours. That means about half of all neonatal deaths take place within 24 hours. The health facility reports should capture most deaths in the first few days.

**2: Data quality metrics**

-   ***Ratio stillbirth to maternal deaths in the health facility data at national level***

We expect maternal mortality and stillbirth to be positively correlated given the commonalities in causes. Based on a review of the global estimates, historical data, and health facility studies, we expect the ratio of stillbirth to maternal death to be in the range of 7 to 30 for countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We compute the ratio as the number of reported stillbirths divided by the number of reported maternal deaths in DHIS2 or MPDSR, in a specific time period (usually a year) and raise a "data quality flag" if the ratio is outside the 7-30 range.

-   If the ratio is lower than 7: underreporting of stillbirths is likely greater than underreporting of maternal deaths

-   If the ratio is equal or greater than 30: underreporting of maternal deaths is likely to be the main issue, underreporting of stillbirth less serious than for maternal deaths

-   If the ratio is between 7 and 30: underreporting of maternal deaths and underreporting of stillbirths are both possible, or reporting of both is of good quality (this requires that the level is also in the expected range -- component 1).

**Figure 5b: Ratio of stillbirths to maternal deaths in health facilities, based on the reported data in DHIS2, 2019-2024, national and regions**

![](vertopal_f4f609e4c40f4b16b7a99c641e5be419/media/image8.png){width="6.5in" height="2.986111111111111in"}

The interpretations can be made in the text of the chartbook.

-   ***Consistency of institutional MMR with estimated population MMR and community MMR***

The completeness of reporting by health facilities can be estimated by comparing the reported iMMR based on facility data with an expected iMMR. The population MMR, community MMR and institutional MMR should be consistent. There will be variation in the community to institutional MMR between populations, but it is not likely that, for instance, the community MMR is 1000 when the institutional MMR is 100.

We compute an expected MMR in health facilities based on assumptions about:

-   MMR in the whole population (including community and institutional deaths). For example, the lower bound, median, upper bounds of global estimates for each country (2023 UN estimates) could be used, or the results from a recent survey.

-   Ratio of community to institutional maternal mortality. We use assumptions ranging from 1.0 (where we assume community MMR is the same as iMMR) to 2.0 and 3.0 (cMMR is 2 or 3 times higher than iMMR).[^fullguide-14] For each country, one should consider what this ratio could be which may depend on the proportion of births in health facilities. There is some evidence that the community to institutional ratio increases as institutional birth rates increase.

-   As well, as the observed percent of births in health facilities.

[^fullguide-14]: The assumptions on the range of ratios for community to institutional MMR were selected based on studies that measured both institutional and population mortality estimates (or had information about the percent of all maternal deaths that occurred at health facilities and the percent of deliveries that took place at health facilities.

The population MMR is the sum of the institutional and community MMR, weighted by the percent of births occurring in facilities. For instance, if the institutional MMR is 100 and the community MMR is 200, and 75% of births are in health facilities, then the population MMR equals 0.75 \* 100 + 0.25 \*200 = 125 per 100,000 live births. This can be expressed in the following formula:

M~p~ = maternal mortality ratio in the population; M~i~ = institutional maternal mortality ratio; M~c~= maternal mortality ratio in the community; P~i~ the proportion of live births in institution, the population maternal mortality ratio can be estimated by:

$M_{p} = P_{i}*M_{i} + \left( 1 - P_{i} \right)*M_{c}$

Here, we have (1) iMMR from the DHIS2 data and (2) population mortality from the UN estimates, and can compute the community MMR as (125 - 0.75 \* 100) / (1-0.25) = 200, or

\$M\_{c} =  \frac{{(M}_{p} - {P_{i}*M}_{i})}{(1 - P_{i})}\$

In the example, the ratio community to institutional mortality (M~c~/M~i~) equals 200 / 100 = 2, in other words the community mortality is two times higher than the institutional mortality.

We can now compute the expected MMR based on 1) an estimate of population MMR 2) the ratio Mc/Mi. For instance, if 75% delivers in health facilities, the population MMR is 200 and the ratio (M~c~/M~i~) is 2, then the expected institutional MMR is (200/(2-(2-1)\*0.75) = 200 / 1.25 = 160 per 100,000 live births. (and the community MMR is 320). In a formula:[^fullguide-15]

[^fullguide-15]: An important factor affecting MMR estimates from health facilities, especially if the data are gathered through MPDSR, is that many deaths occur outside of the maternity ward (upon re-admission). If the DHIS2 is based on the reporting of all cause-specific deaths in health facilities, and the maternal death is correctly classified, this is not an issue.

> Expected M~i~ =M~p~ / (M~c~/M~i~ -- (M~c~/M~i~)-1) \* P~i~))

Finally, the completeness of facility reporting is reported iMMR (e.g. based on DHIS2) divided by the expected iMMR. For instance, if the reported MMR was 100 and the expected MMR 160, then the level of completeness of reporting is 100/160 \* 100% = 62.5%.

Below an example of the estimated completeness of facility reporting of maternal deaths using different scenarios. The figure shows the results on completeness of reporting with three levels of population MMR (lower bound, median or best estimate, upper bound) and three community to institutional mortality ratios (0.5-2.5), shown on the X-axis.

Not all scenarios are equally relevant to each country. For instance, if there is evidence that the population MMR is lower than the UN median, pick the scenario with the lowest MMR (the blue line). If it is considered that community MMR could be 1.5-2.0 times higher than institutional MMR, then the completeness estimate is 59-64%. The choices are arbitrary, but it is useful to consider if the range of estimates of completeness of facility reporting can be narrowed down by using the most plausible scenario. As default values, the ratios of 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 are used.

![](vertopal_f4f609e4c40f4b16b7a99c641e5be419/media/image37.png){width="5.8258650481189855in" height="2.9675043744531933in"}

A similar approach can be used for stillbirths using all births instead of live births. The UN global stillbirth estimates for 2021 with uncertainty ranges can be used (lower and upper bound are 90% uncertainty intervals from the model). There is little research on the community to institutional stillbirth ratio (partly because community level stillbirth reporting is more uncertain) but it is likely that the ratios are lower than for maternal mortality, as institutional mortality levels are much higher for stillbirth rates than for MMR. A range of 0.5-1.5 may be used for the estimation of the level of completeness of facility reporting.

# Section5: Curative health services utilization for sick children {#section5-curative-health-services-utilization-for-sick-children}

## Rationale: Scientific basis for the analysis {#rationale-scientific-basis-for-the-analysis-8}

There is only limited information about curative service utilization, even though diarrhoea and pneumonia are leading causes of death in children. Service utilization statistics on care-seeking behaviour among children with recent illnesses (diarrhoea, acute respiratory infection, or fever in the last 2 weeks) is usually obtained from household surveys, relying on mother's recall. Health facility data on outpatient (OPD) visits are an indicator of access to curative services: less than one visit per person is often considered an indicator of poor access. Similarly, data on hospital admissions are an indicator of access to services, while hospital mortality (case fatality) is an indicator of the quality of care.

## Approach: Description of analytical steps {#approach-description-of-analytical-steps-8}

The data on OPD visits should include new and re-visits. Data are usually reported for under-5 years and 5 years and older. As with data on maternal and newborn care and immunization, the data quality is assessed, and adjustments are made for completeness of reporting and extreme outliers are corrected. The adjusted clean data are used for analysis at national and subnational levels.

### Outpatient service utilization {#outpatient-service-utilization}

The data on outpatient visits should include both new and re-visits.

*Mean number of OPD visits per child per year*:

-   The numerator is the adjusted number of under-5 OPD visits in a year and the denominator is the total number of children under-5 which is taken from the DHIS2 projections.[^fullguide-16] We do not expect this statistic to change much between years (less than 0.2 visits per child per year). A gradual increase suggests either improvements in access to OPD services or a greater disease burden for children. There is no fixed cut-off, but if the attendance is less than 1 visit per year per child, access to services is likely an issue. The OPD statistics are computed for the national and regional/provincial levels.

-   A map with OPD use by region or province can reveal important subnational differences.

-   Regarding the interpretations for OPD: What can be said about the data quality for OPD visits? Is there consistency of reported numbers between years? What is the number of OPD visits per child per year during 2019-2023, is it increasing? Is it lower than 1 visit per year, which is considered indicative of low access? What can be said about the OPD visits per child per year by region/province in 2023? How large is the difference between top and bottom regions?

[^fullguide-16]: For the national level the UN projection may also be taken if there is evidence that this is a better projection. For the subnational level however the DHIS2 projections are currently the only source.

**Figure 6a: OPD service use by children and all ages, national, 2019-2023**

![](vertopal_f4f609e4c40f4b16b7a99c641e5be419/media/image9.png){width="4.5219925634295715in" height="2.348601268591426in"}

*Percent of OPD visits that are children under five years*

The percentage commonly lies between 15-45% of all visits that are under-fives. In high fertility countries (e.g., total fertility rate \> 4) we expect a higher percentage (e.g., over 30%) than in lower fertility countries. If the percent lies outside this range, there may be a data quality problem. Furthermore, if the percent changes much between years (e.g. more than 5 percentage points) then there may also be a data quality issue.

**Figure: Percent of all health facility OPD visits that are under-fives**

![](vertopal_f4f609e4c40f4b16b7a99c641e5be419/media/image2.png){width="5.486907261592301in" height="3.526042213473316in"}

### Inpatient service utilization {#inpatient-service-utilization}

The data on hospital admissions (or discharges + deaths) include new and re-admissions. Data are usually reported for under-5 and 5 years and over. Some countries report discharges rather than admissions which would be the preferred data (discharges = admissions -- deaths).

A review of completeness of reporting and the presence of extreme outliers is to assess data quality. Reporting rates of hospitals (and other facilities with in-patient services) may be more difficult to assess than for other services. Therefore, the decision to adjust for incomplete reporting also depends on the judgement by the country teams regarding the quality of the reporting rate for in-patient services. Also, extreme outliers may be more common for monthly admissions because of poor reporting, and adjustments need to be made cautiously. It is recommended to assess both the unadjusted and adjusted results.

*Number of admissions per 100 children under-5 per year*:

-   This is an indicator of access. A low value, e.g., less than 2 admissions per 100 children under-5 per year, is indicative of low access to services. The median for countries in sub-Saharan Africa for 2018-2022 was 4.5 admissions per year. Also here, we do not expect the indicator to change much per year: e.g. a change of 1 or more admissions per 100 children between years is unlikely, unless a specific explanation can be found (such as an epidemic).

-   A map with IPD admissions among under-five use by region or province can reveal important subnational differences.

-   Is there consistency of reported numbers of admissions / admission rates over time? What is the number of admissions per 100 children under 5 per year during 2019-2023? Trend? Is it low or high? What can be said about admissions per 100 children under-5 per year by region/province in 2023?

*Case fatality rate*: an indicator of the quality of care, defined as the number of children who die in hospital divided by the total number admitted (discharges + deaths). This should be done using the unadjusted data, as we do not adjust: neither the numbers of deaths nor the number of admissions. The case fatality rate is considered an indicator of the quality of care. The lower the mortality in health facilities, the better the quality of care.

**Figure: Case fatality rate per 100 admissions for under-fives and all ages, facility data, 2019-2023**

![](vertopal_f4f609e4c40f4b16b7a99c641e5be419/media/image38.png){width="4.053472222222222in" height="2.9069444444444446in"}

*Percent of admissions that are children under five:* an indicator of data quality. The percentage commonly lies between 10-40% of all admissions that are under-fives. If the percentage lies outside this range, there may be a data quality problem or an exceptional situation. Furthermore, if the percent changes much between years (e.g. more than 5 percentage points), then there may also be a data quality issue.

# Section 6: Health systems progress and performance {#section-6-health-systems-progress-and-performance}

## Rationale: Scientific basis for the analysis {#rationale-scientific-basis-for-the-analysis-9}

The assessment of the burden of disease, the coverage, quality and equity of interventions and the inputs of the health system should guide policy making and targeting of programmes. Subnational analyses are critical: districts and regions/provinces are key units of the health systems and their service delivery. One element of the assessment is a basic assessment of the health system inputs in terms of financing, health workforce and infrastructure and outputs of the system in terms of service utilization and coverage.

## Approach: Description of analytical steps {#approach-description-of-analytical-steps-9}

The focus is on a basic comparison of system outputs (coverage of interventions) with system inputs (infrastructure, workforce, financing) at the subnational level (admin1). More complex methods such as efficiency analyses, frontier analysis, considering socioeconomic level of development and other factors are beyond the scope of this section of the workshop.

### Health system inputs {#health-system-inputs}

First, the assessment focuses on the quality of data for the health system indicators at national and subnational levels. For selected indicators, the assessment should focus on:

1\) comparison with global data for selected indicators (national only)

2\) plausibility of indicator values by subnational units -- major outliers? Improbable patterns?

3\) In addition, it is useful to explore the associations of the health system indicators with each other (e.g. workforce and beds), if only to detect inconsistencies by admin1 (province, region, county). It is also useful to assess the association of the health system performance between different administrative levels (e.g., admin 1 and district) to detect outliers or inconsistencies.

***No health financing indicator:*** Health financing indicators at the district or admin1 levels are difficult to obtain and are often limited to budget and not expenditures. The data also tends to be limited to government resources and may miss on other sources of financing. These data are not used here, but if available, the financial data should be used to assess health system inputs.

***Core health professionals per 10,000 population:*** Health workforce indicators are often of poor quality and not easy to obtain. The main indicator is the number of core health professionals per 10,000 population. These include physicians, non-physician clinicians (depending on the country, but often with surgical skills and multiple years of training but no academic degree), nurses and midwives. In 2006, WHO suggested that at least 23 core health professionals were needed to make major progress in reducing maternal and child mortality with high skilled birth attendance. More recently, higher thresholds have been used: at least 44.5 per 10,000 population to achieve universal health coverage.

**Figure Core health professionals (physicians, nurses, midwives) per 10,000 population, by region and national**

***Number of health facilities per 10,000 population*****:** Health infrastructure is another useful indicator, including all hospitals, health centers and lower level health facilities such as health posts and dispensaries. Both private and public sectors should be included. The number of health facilities per 10,000 population is a crude indicator as it mixes small and large facilities (2 per 10,000 could be used as an indicative number, where less than 2 is considered low).

**Figure: Number of health facilities per 10,000 population, by region and national**

*Number of hospitals per 100,000 population and number of hospital beds per 10,000 population:* Additional insights into the infrastructure for in-patient services can be obtained by computing the number of hospitals per 100,000 population and by the number of hospital beds per 10,000 population.

**Figure: Number of hospitals per 100,000 population, by region and national**

### Health system outputs by inputs at the subnational level {#health-system-outputs-by-inputs-at-the-subnational-level}

The second part of the analysis explores the association between health system inputs and service utilization and coverage by subnational units (admin1). The following can be examined:

*Association between hospital density (per 100,000) and admission rates for children under 5 and beds per 10,000 population and admission rates for children under 5, by admin1.*

-   We expect that regions with lower hospital density have lower admission rates for children, and those with higher density have higher admission rates. This would show as a positive slope of a linear regression line.

-   There may be major outliers. For instance, regions with low density and high admission rates: this may be because (1) hospital density is underreported by these regions (2) hospitals in the low density regions have very high admission and bed occupancy rates (3) hospital admission are overreported in these regions. The interpretation should be based on knowledge of the actual situation in the regions.

![](vertopal_f4f609e4c40f4b16b7a99c641e5be419/media/image15.png){width="5.223958880139983in" height="3.320805993000875in"}

*Association between health workforce (core health professionals per 10,000) and outpatient visits among children under 5, by region*

-   We expect that regions with lower health workforce density have lower OPD utilization rates for children, and those with higher density have higher admission rates. This would show as a positive slope of a linear regression line.

-   There may be major outliers. For instance, regions with low health workforce density and high OPD utilization rates: this may be because (1) health workforce density is underreported by these regions (2) health workers have a very high workload in these regions (3) health workforce density is overreported in these regions (less likely). The interpretation should be based on knowledge of the actual situation in the regions.

![](vertopal_f4f609e4c40f4b16b7a99c641e5be419/media/image16.png){width="5.713542213473316in" height="3.1092760279965006in"}

*Association between health workforce (core health professionals per 10,000) and institutional live birth coverage, by region*

-   For delivery coverage, data by region from either a recent household survey or the most recent DHIS2 data derived estimate can be used.

-   We expect that regions with lower health workforce density have lower institutional delivery rates for children, and those with higher density have higher rates. This would show as the positive slope of a linear regression line.

-   The considerations for the interpretation are the same as above.

![](vertopal_f4f609e4c40f4b16b7a99c641e5be419/media/image10.png){width="5.401780402449694in" height="3.362697944006999in"}

### Private sector and RMNCH services {#private-sector-and-rmnch-services}

The private sector plays an important role in providing RMNCH services. This contribution varies between and within countries. In principle, the master facility list should include all private facilities, but this is often not the case. Routine health facility information aims to include private sector information on for instance the number of deliveries or family planning visits provided but is often incomplete, as reporting may not be as good as in the public sector.

The contribution of the private sector can be estimated using survey data. DHS and MICS include several questions about the source of the services and ask whether this was public or private. Here, we use three indicators to assess the contribution of the private sector nationally, and by urban rural residence of the respondents. We expect that urban women and children rely more on privately owned services than rural women.

Three indicators are used:

· **Deliveries**: Percent of live births occurring in health facilities among all live births in the last two years, by public private; with the share that is private

· **Surgical interventions**: Percent of C-sections that occur in health facilities among all live births in the last two years, by public private; with the share that is private

· **Curative care for children**: percent of children under-five who have sought care for fever, acute respiratory illness or diarrhoea in the last two weeks before the interview, by public private; with the share that is private

Two caveats:

· Rural women may use private services located in urban areas, which means that the percentage of women / children is overestimated for rural residents

· The distinction between private-for-profit and non-profit private facilities is not made in this analysis. Each country uses a different classification and naming convention, and also for the survey respondent this distinction is difficult to make.

Example figures for report here.

# Section 7: Planning ahead for data use {#section-7-planning-ahead-for-data-use}

The aim of the final session of the workshop is to identify at least 2 to 3 concrete actions to take forward the work completed during the workshop. This should include sharing the analytical methods as well as engaging with the "country platform" to share the key findings by June 2024. One important dimension is to ensure the link between the approach and outcomes of the workshop, and reviews of progress and performance led by the Ministry of Health, such as analytical reports for annual reviews or for global reporting. At each step, consider what will be most useful for your audiences to understand and the key messages you want to communicate.

Before you start developing your analyses, consider as a team how these analyses could be used and who the main audiences will be. What insights might they be interested in? What questions could the analyses help answer? What specific decisions or policies can the analyses help address in an evidence-informed way? Think about which platforms and meetings you could engage to reach relevant audiences. To make the most of this opportunity, it will be important to do more than just share the analysis as a one-off event, so also think about how to feed into routine forums where data and analyses are used and decisions are taken. For example, this could include having working sessions with your target audiences not only to share the findings but also to explore some of the concepts learned during the workshop and to strengthen their capacity to interpret these types of analyses themselves and identify opportunities for action (see further suggestions below). Also, think about how this will link to your Countdown country collaboration and existing plans to build capacity for RMNCAH data analysis and use.

# Introduction to Countdown to 2030

## Overview of the Countdown to 2030 (The Countdown)

The **Countdown to 2030 for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health (The Countdown)** initiative is a global collaboration involving academics from national, regional, and international institutions, UN agencies, the World Bank, and civil society organizations. The initiative tracks progress in Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, and Adolescent Health and Nutrition (RMNCAH+N), fostering advocacy and accountability through rigorous data analysis.

**Key objectives include:**

-   Strengthening country-led data analysis and monitoring

-   Fostering innovation and evidence generation through multi-country \> collaboration

-   Enhancing global measurement and monitoring

-   Improving policy and program communication

For more on Countdown to 2030 initiative, visit: [[https://www.countdown2030.org/about]{.underline}](https://www.countdown2030.org/about)

## About the cd2030.rmncah R Package

The cd2030.rmncah R package and Shiny App were developed to support evidence generation and analysis of RMNCAH indicators. Key features include:

-   User-friendly interface for data management and analysis

-   Tools for visualization and statistical summarization

-   Automated report generation

# Loading data

This section explains how to structure and upload data into the app, ensuring compatibility with the **Countdown Health facility data format**

Please note that should you update your data during the workshop, ensure it is in the correct format before uploading to avoid errors.

## **Supported File Formats**

The app supports uploading the following file types:

-   .xls, .xlsx (Excel files)- The raw health facility dataset in the \> Countdown format

-   .dta (Stata files) - Master dataset downloaded from the app after \> validation/adjustment

-   .rds (R Cached datafile) - The file containing the preloaded \> dataset, user adjustments and analysis parameters that has been \> saved in the Cache directory. This will be the last saved file.

## **How to Upload Data**

**Step 1: Prepare Your data file**

Ensure your data is cleaned and structured according to the **The Countdown Health facility data format** by:

-   Using the provided **HFD Standardized Template** to format your data \> correctly.

-   Saving the file in a supported format: .xls, .xlsx, .dta, or .rds.

Step 2: Upload the File

1.  Navigate to the **Upload Data** section of the app.

2.  **Drag and drop** your file into the upload box, or click **Browse** \> to select it manually in your directory.

3.  For subsequent re-uploads (after the initial uploading of the .xls, \> .xlsx, .dta files and saving your progress in .rds file using the \> Cache Directory button), do not reupload the .xls, .xlsx, .dta but \> the saved .rds file if you want to retain any changes made in your \> analytical files

4.  The app will validate your file against the **Countdown format**.

    -   If successful, a confirmation message will appear: *"Upload \> successful: Your file is ready for analysis."*

    -   If errors are detected, an error message will indicate the \> issue.

## **Common Errors and How to Fix Them**

| **Error Message** | **Cause** | **Solution** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| "Unsupported file format" | File type not supported | Save your file as .xls, .xlsx, .dta, or .rds. |
| "The following required columns are missing from the data: opv1" | Missing essential columns in the data | Add the missing column(s) to your dataset and ensure their values are valid. |
| "The following sheets are missing: Service_data_1, Service_data_2, Service_data_3, Reporting_completeness, Population_data, Admin_data" | Missing one or more required sheets in the file | Add the missing sheets to your file and ensure they conform to the template. |
| "Sheet Service_data_3 is empty" | The sheet exists but contains no data | Populate the sheet with valid data or remove the empty sheet. |
| "Key Columns "month" missing in Service_data_3" | A key column district, year, or month, is missing from the specified sheet | Add the missing column(s) to the sheet and ensure the data is structured correctly. |
| "Column name month must not be duplicated. Use .name_repair to specify repair." | Duplicate column names in the dataset | Ensure all column names are unique. Rename or remove duplicate columns. |

***Note**: If a key column (district, year, or month) is missing data in a row, that row will be excluded from the resulting dataset.*

## **Tips for a Successful Upload**

-   Always use the latest **The Countdown Health facility data format** \> template to structure your data.

-   Double-check column names, formats, and content before uploading.

-   Save your file in a supported format and ensure it is UTF-8 encoded
